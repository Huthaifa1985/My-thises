There are a number of people without whom this thesis might not have been written,
and to whom I am greatly indebted.

To 
thank you for giving me the chance a ‘writing space’ and for nurturing me through the months of
writing. And also for the myriad of ways in which, throughout my life, you have
actively supported me in my determination to find and realise my potential, and to
make this contribution to our world.



Thanks to dear Kamal and Azaria, for being so supportive - even when being ‘without
Mum’ was hard, and for your help with the bibliography and diagrams. This work is
for, and because of you and all the generations to come. It is dedicated to all our
journeys in learning to thrive.


There are a number of people without whom this thesis might not have been written,
and to whom I am greatly indebted.

To my father, Prof Ziad Abu hammad, who continues to learn, grow and develop and who has been a
source of encouragement and inspiration to me throughout my life, a very special
thank you for giving me the chance a ‘writing space’ and for nurturing me through the months of
writing. And also for the myriad of ways in which, throughout my life, you have
actively supported me in my determination to find and realise my potential, and to
make this contribution to our world.

To my mother-in-law, Maryam, known only briefly but loved and missed, who
represented to me ‘living proof’ of Black women’s ability to redefine and recreate our
lives despite, and maybe even because of, the tremendously constraining, oppressive
and repressive situations in which we often exist.
To my dear husband, Bala who remains willing to engage with the struggle, and
ensuing discomfort, of having a partner who refuses to accept the given role of the
"Black woman" and is actively engaged in redefining and redesigning that role. A
very special thank you for your practical and emotional support as I added the roles of
wife and then mother, to the competing demands of business, work, study and
personal development.
Thanks to dear Kamal and Azaria, for being so supportive - even when being ‘without
Mum’ was hard, and for your help with the bibliography and diagrams. This work is
for, and because of you and all the generations to come. It is dedicated to all our
journeys in learning to thrive.
